# Find-the-Most-Frequent-Element-in-an-Array
Given an array of integers, find the element that appears the most number of times. If there are multiple elements with the same maximum frequency, return any one of them.
 Explanation:
A HashMap stores the frequency of each number.

As we update the frequency, we track the number with the highest frequency.

At the end, we output the most frequent element and how many times it appeared.
